# Copy Management System

The objective of this repository is to manage all the outbound copies from one place. Whatever the tool we're using to reach Gorgias leads, we make the changes here. A PR will be created for every update, allowing another team member to approve the changes. Also, we'll be able to run GitHub actions on the content of the copies, checking for improvements/errors/deliverability score.
